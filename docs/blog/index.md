## [iOS Multiple Projects Workspace Setup][15.1]{target=_blank}

It’s not a rare case when software engineers are involved in the development of a few projects simultaneously, for one or even a few products.

Usually, it requires additional dancing around the projects, VCS repositories and their dependencies set up.

This writing is mostly about tools, such as Xcode, AppCode, PODs, and how to set up comfortable multi projects workspace, using them.

## [Dynamic textures in Sceneform][14.1]{target=_blank}

Recently Android Graphics team presented a cross platform, real-time physically based rendering engine for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and WebGL— Filament.

Then, on top of it, they’ve built Sceneform — library that in pair with ARCore, helps to render realistic 3D scenes in AR and non-AR apps, without having to learn OpenGL.

## [Secure data in Android — Encryption in Android (Part 1)][9.1]{target=_blank}

In previous “Encryption” article we spoke about basics of Cryptography:
algorithm types (symmetric, asymmetric), cipher types (stream, block), modes,
paddings and key types.

This article will show you how encryption works in Android.

## [Secure data in Android — Encryption][8.1]{target=_blank}

The most effective way to achieve data security.
And in this article series, we will mostly focus on it.

To read an encrypted data, you must have access to a secret key or password that
allows you to decrypt it. Unencrypted data is called plain data (plain text),
encrypted data is referred to as cipher data (cipher text).

## [Have you ever tried to convert Github Wiki into PDF?][7.1]{target=_blank}

Github wiki is a great solution for creating well struct and easy to browse
documentations. More of that it is placed near your code, issues and release
notes. Yeah Github is great :)

But what if you are working on private repo, SDK is in active development phase
and you need to share doc with potential customer ?

## [Best Practice - SharedPreferences][5.1]

Android provides many ways of storing application data. One of those ways leads
us to the **SharedPreferences** object which is used to store private primitive
data in key-value pairs.

All logic are based only on three simple classes...
