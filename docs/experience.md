## Founder

A few years ago I've finally made it - [Mospan Tales](https://mospantales.com/en/),
a solo Mobile Indie Games Studio. There, during my free time and together with my family, I'm creating my own tales.

- Currently in progress - [The D Adventure](https://thedadventure.mospantales.com/en/), a 2D mobile action platformer game with a dinosaur theme, focused on fast-paced gameplay and handcrafted levels.

## Contributor

This is so cool - not to invent your own wheel if there is someone who have done it before. I'm pretty sure that this should be true for both sides. That's why I'm always trying to share my own wheels with other developers.
